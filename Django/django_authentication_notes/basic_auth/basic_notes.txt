=================== BASIC AUTHENTICATION================================
This authentication scheme uses HTTP Basic Authentication, signed against a user's username and password.

If successfully authenticated, BasicAuthentication provides the following credentials.

=>request.user will be a Django User instance.
=>request.auth will be None.

Note: If you use BasicAuthentication in production you must ensure that your API is only available over https. You should also ensure that your API clients will always re-request the username and password at login, and will never store those details to persistent storage.

Q: How to use in python requests?

import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
res = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/basic",auth = HTTPBasicAuth('superuser','superuser'))

POSTMAN::
Go to Authorization / Basic Auth
